Password Generator to create random password based on user criteria

The purpose of this application is to generate a random passsword based on user selected choices (numbers, special characters, upper/lowercase letters) - it runs in the browser and is powered by Javascript. 

The user will select criteria and a randomly generated password will be provided on screen.

# Steps

The user will click the generate password button and will be led through a series of prompts and confirmations on desired criteria. 

The user will not be allowed to continue forward until a valid number between 8 and 128 is provided. 

Once the length is provided, the user will confirm if they would like the random password to include any of the following:

Lowercase Characters
Uppercase Characters
Numbers
Special Characters

Once the user has confirmed the criteria, a random password will be generated that will include at least one character type that was confirmed by the user. 

The random password will show in the alert as well as on screen in the password text area.
